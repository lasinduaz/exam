Factorial
‚Ä¢ We read n! as ‚Äún factorial‚Äù
‚Ä¢ n! = n*(n-1)*(n-2)*...*2*1, and that 0! = 1.
‚Ä¢ A recursive definition is

(n)! = {n * (n-1)! if n>0}  Recursive Call
{1
if n=0}   Initial Condition

Recursion tree
‚Ä¢ We can draw a recursion tree for any recursive function.
‚Ä¢ Drawing a recursion tree will help us to graphically visualize
the recursive relation.
‚Ä¢ Let‚Äôs draw the recursion tree for the factorial function



Definition of Recursive Relation
A recursive relation for the sequence {an} is an equation that
expresses an in terms of one or more of the previous terms of the
sequence, for all integers n >= n0, where n0 is a non-negative
integer.
‚Ä¢ The condition n = n0 is called the initial condition.
‚Ä¢ NOTE: some cases may contain more than one initial condition.
e.g. Fibonacci numbers

Base case(s).
‚Ä¢ Values of the input variables for which we perform no recursive calls
are called base cases (there should be at least one base case).
‚Ä¢ Every possible chain of recursive calls must eventually reach a base
case.
‚Ä¢ Recursive calls.
‚Ä¢ Calls to the current method.
‚Ä¢ Each recursive call should be defined so that it makes progress
towards a base case.


i need you explain(teaches) these answers with steps 
So question
The number of bacteria in a colony doubles every hour. If
the colony begins with 05 bacteria, how many will be present
in 2 hours?
Answers (can not have idea to solove this )
‚Ä¢ Recursive relation:
Let an be the number of bacteria after n hours.
an = 2.an-1
Initial condition a0 = 5.
‚Ä¢ Solution: Solve for a2 given this relation.
a2 = 2*a1 = 2*2*a0 = 2*2*5 = 20


The Master Method
‚Ä¢ The Master method applies to recurrences of the form
T(n) = a T(n/b) + f(n)
where a ‚â• 1 and b > 1, and f(n) is an asymptotically positive function.
The recurrence describes the running time of an algorithm that divides a
problem of size n into a sub problems, each of size n/b, where a and b are
positive constants. The a sub problems are solved recursively, each in time T
(n/b). The cost of dividing the problem and combining the results of the sub
problems is described by the function f (n).


‚Ä¢ Suppose Sunil deposits Rs.10,000 in a savings account at a bank,
yielding 11% interest per year with interest compounded
annually. How much will be in the account after 30 years?Solution
‚Ä¢ Solution:
Let Pn denote the amount in the account after n years. Then the
sequence {Pn} satisfies the recursive relation:
Pn = Pn-1 + 0.11 Pn-1 = (1.11)Pn-1
The initial condition is P0 = 10,000.
Note that:
P1 = (1.11)P0
P2 = (1.11)P1 (That means 1.11*1.11P0) = (1.11)2 P0
P3 = (1.11)P2 = (1.11)3 P0
We see a pattern! In general,
Pn = (1.11)Pn-1 = (1.11)n P0. For n = 30, P30 = (1.11)3010,000.



Recurrence equation
‚Ä¢ Mathematical function that define the running time of recursive
functions.
‚Ä¢ This describes the overall running time on a problem of size n in
terms of the running time on smaller inputs.
‚Ä¢ when an algorithm contains a recursive call to itself, its running
time can often be described by a recurrence. A recurrence is an
equation or inequality that describes a function in terms of its
value on smaller inputs.
‚Ä¢ A recurrence relation for T(N) is simply a recursive
definition of T(N).
‚Ä¢ This means T(N) is written as a function of T(k) where k < N.
‚Ä¢ Two common types are:
‚Ä¢ T(N) = T(N-1) + b
‚Ä¢ T(N) = T(N/2) + c



Repeated substitution method(Example 01)
Example 1:
T(n) = T(n ‚àí 1) + c , n > 1 & c is a small positive constant. :T(1) = d
T(n) = T(n ‚àí 1) + c
= (T(n ‚àí 2) + c) + c
= (T(n ‚àí 2) + 2c
=(T(n ‚àí 3) + c) + 2c
T(n)= nc + (d ‚àí c)
= (T(n ‚àí 3) + 3c
Running Time : O(n)
‚Ä¶.after k times
= (T(n ‚àí k) + k c
If k=n-1
= T(n ‚àí (n ‚àí 1)) + (n ‚àí 1)c
= T(1) + (n ‚àí 1)c
= d + (n ‚àí 1)c

here example for above topic teach me this (having hard time of in mathamatics need to explain small stuff in mathamatics )



Calculate the running time as Operation count for the following process parts

int i= 10;
while (i>=2)
{
printf(‚ÄúHello‚Äù);
i=i-2;
}

calculate the step count 
int i= 10;
while (i>=2)
{
printf(‚ÄúHello‚Äù);
i=i-2;
}

Hi! I‚Äôm currently learning Design and Analysis of Algorithms (DAA) for university.

My lecture notes are often written in bullet/point form only, and the actual explanations are given in class ‚Äî which I sometimes miss or struggle to fully grasp.

I want you to act like a university-level DAA teacher and help me understand the meaning and importance of each point or concept in a clear and structured way.

üîΩ Here's what I expect from your explanation:

    Explain the concepts just like a professor would in class

    Use simple language first, then expand if needed

    If an example or illustration will make it easier to understand, please add it

    Keep it focused and clear ‚Äî not just textbook definitions
    
    
#Asymptotic Notations
Asymptotic notations are the mathematical notations used to
describe the running time of an algorithm. It used when the input
tends towards a particular value or a limiting value.
Why we need of Asymptotic Notation?
ÔÇß Ignore machine dependent constants.
ÔÇß RAM Model have some problems.
ÔÇß Exact analysis is very complicated
ÔÇß Sufficiently large size of n.
ÔÇß Growth of T(n) as n --> ‚àû


Asymptotic Notations (Cont.)

Step count is determined to be
c1n2 +c2n + c3,
Let‚Äôs take the ratio ùëü ùëõ
c1> 0
ùëê2 ùëõ+ùëê3
=
ùëê1 ùëõ2
r(n)
When n is large r(n)
tends to zero.

Suppose that programs A and B perform the same task.
Assume that one person has determined the step counts of
these programs to be t A(n)=2n2+3n and t B(n)=13n.
ÔÇß Which program is the faster one ?
ÔÇß What is the answer ,if the step count of the program B is
2n+n2 ?

#Graphs of functions
Nn>n! >2n>n3 > n2 > n log a > n > log n > 1
#Asymptotic Notations(Contd.)
There are three notations.
O - Notation
ÔÅë - Notation
ÔÅó - Notation

ÔÇß Focus on what‚Äôs important by abstracting away low-order
terms and constant factors.
ÔÇß How we indicate running times of algorithms.
ÔÇß A way to compare ‚Äúsizes‚Äù of functions:
ÔÇß O ‚âà ‚â§ -- Consider the Upper Bound
‚Ä¢ ÔÅë ‚âà ‚â• --Consider the Both(Average)
‚Ä¢ ÔÅó ‚âà = -- Consider the Lower Boun


#Big O - Notation
ÔÇß Introduced by Paul Bechman in 1892.
ÔÇß We use Big O-notation to give an upper bound on a
function. And consider as the Worst Case Scenarios.
Definition:
Eg: What is the big O value of f(n)=2n + 6 ?
g(n)=n therefore f(n)=O(n)
an xn + ... + a1 x + a0 is O( xn ) for any real numbers an , ..., a0
and any nonnegative number n

#Hash Files

‚Ä¢ Search (Equality): good for equality (if based on
search key). Otherwise scan table
‚Ä¢ Search (Range): needs to scan the file
‚Ä¢ Insert: search for primary bucket (hash) and insert
‚Ä¢ Delete: search for primary bucket (hash) if available,
else scan file & delete record
‚Ä¢ Hash File is an Indexed File
‚Ä¢ Hash indexes are best for equality selections.
‚Ä¢ Do not support range searches.
1. Static Hashing
2. Dynamic hashing



is these steps true ?
Step-by-step Process:
Let‚Äôs say we want to insert a record with some key (like student_id, employee_id, etc.).

üî¢ Example:
Let‚Äôs insert a record with key = 37

We are using:

A hash function:

‚Ñé
(
ùëò
ùëí
ùë¶
)
=
ùëò
ùëí
ùë¶
m
o
d
‚Äâ
‚Äâ
ùëÅ
h(key)=keymodN
Suppose N = 4 (we have 4 buckets: 0, 1, 2, 3)

‚úÖ Step 1: Apply Hash Function
‚Ñé
(
37
)
=
37
m
o
d
‚Äâ
‚Äâ
4
=
1
h(37)=37mod4=1
üîç So, this record should be stored in Bucket 1.

‚úÖ Step 2: Check the Target Bucket (Bucket 1)
If there is enough space in Bucket 1:
‚Üí Just insert the record there.

If Bucket 1 is full:
‚Üí Add an overflow page linked to Bucket 1, and insert the record into that overflow page.

üìù This page acts like a backup stack for records that couldn‚Äôt fit into the main bucket.
